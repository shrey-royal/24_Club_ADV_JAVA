Problem Statement: Event Management System

-> Key Features of the Event Management System:
1. Create an Event
2. Register for an Event
3. View Events
4. Manage Registrations

-> Components and Approach:

1. Data Storage:
   - Use in-memory data structures (e.g., 'ArrayList') to store events and registrations.
   - Optionally, use files (e.g., text or JSON files) for persistent storage between server restarts.

2. Servlets:
   - EventCreationServlet: Handles the creation of new events.
   - EventRegistrationServlet: Manages user registration for events.
   - EventListServlet: Displays a list of available events.
   - RegistrationListServlet: Shows a list of registrations for a specific event.

3. Data Structures:
   - Event: A class representing an event with properties like ID, name, date, and description.
   - Registration: A class representing a registration with properties like event ID and user details.
